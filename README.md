# LangChain: Creating AI Powered Apps with LangChain

LangChain is a Python library that simplifies natural language processing (NLP) tasks. With LangChain, you can access various state-of-the-art language models from leading providers such as OpenAI, Cohere, Huggingface Hub, IBM WatsonX, and many more.

## Key Features

- **Universal Interface**: Seamless integration with various Language Large Models (LLM).
- **Prompt Management**: Tools for handling, optimizing, and serializing prompts.
- **Conversation Chains**: Creating complex dialogs using language models.
- **Memory Interface**: Facilitating storage and retrieval of model information.
- **Indexes**: Utility functions for loading specific text data.
- **Agents and Tools**: Allowing the setup of agents that can use tools such as Google Search, Wikipedia, or a calculator.

## Gradio Usage

LangChain also supports the use of Gradio to facilitate model usage with an easy-to-use user interface. Here are some examples of using Gradio with LangChain:

1. **Creating Simple Chatbots**: Universal interface for various LLMs.
2. **Creating Cover Letter Bots**: Working with prompts to create cover letter bots.
3. **Chatbot Support Chatbot**: Building chains for chatbot support.
4. **Utility Functions for Accessing and Storing Files**: Indexes used for file access and storage.
5. **Friend Chatbot**: Implementation of a memory interface for chatbots.
6. **Python Code Writer Bot**: Setting up agents that can use tools such as Google Search, Wikipedia, or a calculator.

## Conclusion

By completing this project, you have mastered the skills of deploying new Machine Learning models using Gradio. The application you have produced can be accessed by anyone with the implemented URL, as long as the server is not shut down on the Code Engine CLI.
